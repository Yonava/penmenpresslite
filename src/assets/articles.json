        "content":"Students have recently noticed some issues in the dining hall with long lines, food quality and moldy products. Sodexo responded to the complaints in an interview with Sodexo’s General Manager, Daniel VanAvery. As seen on social media platforms such as the SNHU Barstool Instagram, students have reported receiving moldy bread, salad with plastic in it, uncooked steak, uncooked chicken, and rubber bands around broccoli. “It was a mistake. I think we got it all squared away. For a week it happened regularly,” said VanAvery when asked about the moldy bread. VanAvery explained that some deliveries were marked with the wrong dates when shipped at the beginning of the semester. The Sodexo team uses the same method of putting out food as grocery stores do; food expiring sooner goes to the front and food expiring later goes to the back. Thinking the bread was only one day old, as it was labeled, it was brought to the front. In reality it was three days old and was served to some students. VanAvery also commented when asked about students finding rubber bands around their stalks of vegetables. He said Sodexo struggled with staffing throughout the pandemic and his staff is “working back-to-back shifts” and putting in long hours at the dining hall, so a couple meals were missed in production and served to students. Longer lines have also been a problem in the dining hall, even longer than in previous years on campus. When asked about the matter VanAvery said, “70 percent of their staff is new….We had 50 job openings, staff retired and then the pandemic happened.” Sodexo staff is working long shifts to get through the nearly 30,000 transactions in just a week. With new staff needing to be trained and other staff needing to be in different areas in the kitchen, the lines got longer. Staff shortages and delivery issues caused a stir in the dining hall since returning to campus. “It was a mistake….It’s not okay. At no point is it okay and…of course, it’s not [Sodexo’s] standard. Our goal is always to serve the best food. Good food every day,” said VanAvery."

        "content":"Singer-songwriter Taylor Swift is set to release her album, “Red (Taylor’s Version),” on November 12. It will include all of the songs from her “Red” album (2012) along with an extended 10-minute song and unheard selections from the vault. Tracks from the vault will feature Chris Stapleton, Phoebe Bridgers, Mark Foster, and Ed Sheeran. “I can’t wait til we can dust off our highest hopes and relive these memories together. We’ll also be making a bunch of new ones, too,” Swift said in a social media post. Since the beginning of 2021, Swift has been working on releasing all her previous albums re-recorded. “Fearless (Taylor’s Version),” was released in April and has risen to the number one spot on The Rolling Stones Top 200 Album Chart, according to Rolling Stones Director of Charts, Emily Blake. Swift also released a re-recorded single from her “1989” album, “Wildest Dreams” in September. Next in the music lineup will be the release of more Taylor’s Version albums, including “Red,” “Speak Now,” “1989,” and “Reputation.” However, Swift will have to wait until 2022 for the latter due to the contract with the previous record label, Big Machine Records. Controversy sparked after the artist left Big Machine Records and signed onto Republic Records and Universal Music Group in 2018. In an article explaining why she is re-recording her album, journalist Jessica Sager wrote in Parade, “Swift would later reveal that she attempted to negotiate with Big Machine to gain ownership of the masters of her first six albums but was turned down.” This included her not being allowed to perform her old songs at the 2019 AMAs after winning Artist of the Decade. However, the artist was able to perform her original setlist, including the following titles: “The Man,” “Love Story,” “I Knew You Were Trouble,” “Blank Space,” “Shake It Off,” and “Lover.” Despite the setback, Swift has recorded three albums, including “Lover,” “Folklore,” and “Evermore.” Fans and other music lovers can listen to her music on streaming services such as Spotify, Apple Music, or can download them from the iTunes Store."

        "content":"Fine dining is not usually a staple of the college experience, but from time to time there is the need to have a fancy dinner. Be it an anniversary, a birthday, or even a graduation, the Hanover Street Chophouse is the place to go. As the name implies, it is located on Hanover Street in Manchester, approximately 15 minutes from SNHU’s main campus. They offer incredible dishes of steak and fish cuts, along with a robust wine and whiskey menu. Their selection of the appetizers, sides, and main courses is relatively small, but what the menu lacks in quantity is made up for in quality. Their bacon-wrapped sea scallops served with their house horseradish mustard is sublime. The maple bacon blending with the salty scallops and the kick of the horseradish mustard make for a wonderful start to the night. Other appetizers include the Colossal Crab Cocktail: crab served with avocado and fritonaise sauce; HSC Meatballs, served with a celery root puree, mushrooms, and grana padana; and Wagyu Beef Carpaccio, served with arugula, Worcestershire aioli, truffle, parmesan, and crostini. Their main courses are the real show-stoppers. Most dishes offered are steak, ranging from prime New York sirloin to prime Delmonico. A selection of steak add-ons complete the meal, some of the best being the truffle butter and the bacon maple bourbon jam. The filet mignon with bacon maple jam has a perfect combination of flavors. It cuts like butter and is topped with the rich flavor of the jam. They also have some other house specialties ranging from swordfish steak to chicken parmesan. To add to the meal selection, the Hanover Street Chophouse also has a variety of sides to go with the main course. These include roasted mushrooms, baked mac n’ cheese, hand-cut French fries and truffled tater tots. The Hanover Street Chophouse also hosts an impressive collection of wines, whiskeys and cocktails. With a full wine cellar beneath the restaurant, there are an overwhelming number of options to choose from. However, the servers are happy to help. Their cocktails are not half bad as well. Their B’s Knees is sweet with a punch, and nobody can go wrong with a classic Old Fashioned. Make no mistake, this is fine dining. A meal at the Chophouse will run a pretty penny, with their least expensive steak cut, an 8-ounce filet mignon, costing $42.00. However, when the time comes for an above-average meal for a celebration, the Hanover Street Chophouse is the place to go."
